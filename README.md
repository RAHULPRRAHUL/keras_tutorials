# Tutorials using keras for Machine learning
Here I will add notebooks about how to use keras for training private datasets. This means, wild data that you own or are not a built-in function of other python library.

For the moment I have the following tutorials:  
## <a href="https://github.com/bsaldivaremc2/keras_tutorials/blob/master/Keras%20-%20StarCraft%20unit%20prediction%20from%20disk%20-%20FC.ipynb" target="_blank">keras - StarCraft unit prediction from disk - FC.ipynb. </a>
### Added on 20180418.
Here you can see:
* How to train a keras model using Fully Connected (FC) Layers. FC are also called multilayer perpectrons.
* How to train images from disk (HDD) by batch. In order words, only load them into memory when training in a given batch.
* How to train using manual features, in this case a histogram of all the channels of an image.

## <a href="https://github.com/bsaldivaremc2/keras_tutorials/blob/master/Keras%20-%20StarCraft%20Unit%20Classification%20from%20disk.ipynb" target="_blank"> Keras - StarCraft Unit Classification from disk.ipynb. </a>
### Added on 20180419.
Here you can see:  
* how to train an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).  
* how to train using images inside a zip file, by batch. In order words, only load them into memory when training in a given batch, without unziping all the content of the zip file.
* how to save and restore a keras model.
